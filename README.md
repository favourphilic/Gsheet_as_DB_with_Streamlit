# Gsheet_as_DB_with_Streamlit
The code here shows how to use private googlesheet as a database and data entry purpose with streamlit

Take a quick look at the app [ButhTempHumAPP](https://buthtemperatureapp.streamlit.app/)

`a simple streamlit app that can record daily temperature and humidity of a particular drug store.
Medications has to be stored in the right temperature and other conditions to ensure that its efficacy, 
effectiveness, quality among other things are not impeded. So, I decided to build this app because we usually record the daily temperature chart manually in my workplace.
This has resulted in loss of data and incomplete data entry in some cases. 
Building an app will ensure only validated data are entered into the database and avoid the fear of data loss`
